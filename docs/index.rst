c is for Camera
===============

A 35mm camera, based on the `Canonet G-III QL17 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonet_G-III_QL17>`_ rangefinder,
simulated in Python.

The purpose of this project is to explore and understand the logic in the mechanisms of a camera by using
object-oriented programming to simulate real-world objects.

See :ref:`understanding-camera` for more about *how* the camera is simulated.
